description: Edwin's Mathem Problem Solving code gives Edwin the capability to read
  a math problem, solve it, and write the answer in the proper position. This project
  aims to make Edwin more organic by slowing down his problem solving and showing
  more of the steps, so to speak. Additionally, the angle of "Edwin does your homework"
  is appealing for demos.
