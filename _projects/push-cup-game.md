# Description

Push Cup is a simple game designed by Connor Novak during the Fall 2016 semester. The game is played on a white playing field with a red SOLO cup and a black dot representing the goal. Edwin and the player take turns pushing the cup, the player pushing the cup off of the goal and Edwin returning the cup to a position covering the goal.

# Purpose

Push Cup was designed to demonstrate Edwin and a human interacting safely and cooperatively within a physical space. Edwin was able to understand when the human was interacting with the cup and when they were finished, thus demonstrating a concept of "turns".
